## Number Word Statistics

A single page app which provides a simple interface to a flexible
number-to-number-words algorithm.

The rules for converting a number into a number word (e.g. 123 ->
one hundred twenty three) are not hardcoded but can be modified by
the end user, allowing one to define any arbitrary rule set. A few
predefined rule sets are provided as examples.
